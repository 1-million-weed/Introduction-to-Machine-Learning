This prep did not go well. But i did the past exam and end of lecture questions and that was enough.

Great tip for this subject is just to go to lectures and engage to try and understand the material, because cramming all of this right before the exam is too much.

# 1. Questions at the end of lectures

## Lecture 1

Notes: [[Lecture 1]]
Slides: [[02 Introduction to Machine Learning.pdf]] 
### Questions
