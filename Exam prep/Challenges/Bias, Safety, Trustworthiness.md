- As AI is deployed in real-world applications—especially those involving humans—it is **crucial** to ensure it does not perform unexpected actions or behave abnormally.
- Right now, there are AI systems that may **actively harm** people, for example:
    - In the US, poorly understood AI systems are used to predict whether someone might commit a crime or determine the length of their sentence.
    - AI systems are used for monitoring populations, potentially violating human rights.
    - AI tools are used by banks for loan decisions and by companies to decide on job interviews.
    - Instances of **discrimination** have occurred (e.g., DUO and the Toeslagenaffaire/Benefits scandal).
