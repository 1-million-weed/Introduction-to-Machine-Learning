- The biggest issue currently in AI is the lack of **generalization**.
    - In other words, solutions are built for specific problems, and true general AI (AGI) does not yet exist.
- **Alpha Go** and its variants (Alpha Go Zero, Alpha Zero) successfully play Go, yet these advances have not translated effectively to other domains.
- **Deep Blue** can play chess but has not addressed broader global issues (peace, hunger, wealth distribution, etc.).
- **All models** overfit to some degree, though many are still quite useful in practice.
