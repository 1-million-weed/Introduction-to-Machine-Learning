- The biggest bottleneck for building effective models is obtaining **high-quality data** (including features and labels).
    - Without sufficient data, a model cannot be learned.
- **Low-quality data** (e.g., incorrect labels, unclear or useless features, missing values) significantly undermines model performance.
- Classic reminder: **Garbage in, Garbage out** â€” poor input inevitably leads to poor results.
