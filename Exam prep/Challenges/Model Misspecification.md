- Model misspecification occurs when you use the **wrong model** for a given dataset.
- In simple terms, you have some features/data, a task, and a target to predict, but:
    - We do **not** know which model would be best for that task.
- Generally, you do not know the true mathematical model that generated your data.
    - This is especially true for **highly dimensional data**.
- Because of this, we often resort to trial-and-error and further research to identify the most suitable model.
