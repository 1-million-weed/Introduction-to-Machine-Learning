- Most AI methods overall are **Black Boxes**:
    - It is difficult to interpret their decisions or explain how those decisions are made.
- **Explanations and interpretability** are required for AI to gain human trust, and in some places (e.g., the EU under GDPR) they are legally mandated.
- **Explaining black box methods** is very difficult, as computational concepts do not necessarily map to human-understandable concepts; the non-linear nature of many models complicates this further.
- **Building easily interpretable methods** (often called white box methods) is also challenging, and in many cases these methods can be less accurate than black box models.
