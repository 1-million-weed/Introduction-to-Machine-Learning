>[!note] Look at lecture slides for general info about the course. Very clear and structured

## What you need for AGI 

- Adaptivity & adaptability
- Learning
- Generalization

## The qualification problem

Work in specialised cases but not in anything where you didnt apply conditions

## Data driven Paradigms

Images of cats and dogs, labels and train. But you need a lot
if only trained on a subset of cats of dogs (asian dogs look like food)

### Learning paradigms

#### Supervised learning 

This is right this is wrong

Limited by the amount of data you have.

#### Unsupervised learning
