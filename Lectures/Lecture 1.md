# Course info
>[!note] Look at lecture slides for general info about the course. Very clear and structured

- Practicals are weekly starting week 2
- **Grade** is determined:
	- 50% homework x 3
		- first two are theory, last is fully practical
	- 50% exam
		- 40% multiple choice
		- 60% written

# Introduction
- Machine learning: algorithms learning from data
- types:
	- supervised
	- unsupervised
	- reinforced learning
- python libraries:
	- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - tabular data analysis tool.
	- [Pymarc](https://pypi.org/project/pymarc/) - for working with bibliographic data encoded in MARC21.
	- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - data visualization tools.
	- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - for parsing HTML and XML documents.
	- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - for making HTTP requests (e.g., for web scraping, using APIs)
	- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - machine learning tools for predictive data analysis.
	- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - numerical computing tools such as mathematical functions and random number generators.

## What you need for AGI 

- [[Adaptivity & adaptability]]: learning from mistakes and improving
- [[Learning]]: acquiring new knowledge and understanding
- [[Generalization]]: Lessons learned should be general and widely applicable

## The qualification problem

It is really difficult to make a pre-condition list in real life.
Actions can have unintended consequences, enumerating these is also nearly impossible.
#_Err_Mismatch 
Work in specialised cases but not in anything where you didn't apply conditions

## Data driven Paradigms

Images of cats and dogs, labels and train. But you need a lot
if only trained on a subset of cats of dogs (asian dogs look like food)

### Learning paradigms

#### Supervised learning 

This is right this is wrong

Limited by the amount of data you have.

#### Unsupervised learning
